# stmp CLI Tool

## Introduction

stmp is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help developers and other professionals track their work hours and notes. Born out of the need for a simple, flexible, and efficient time tracking tool, stmp aims to make time management as seamless as possible.

## Features

- **Work Hours Tracking**: Easily log your start and end times for each work day.
- **Break Duration**: Keep track of your break times to ensure you're taking adequate rest.
- **Notes**: Add notes to each work day for better context and recall.
