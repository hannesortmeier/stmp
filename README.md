# stmp CLI Tool

## Introduction

stmp is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help developers and other professionals track their work hours and notes. Born out of the need for a simple, flexible, and efficient time tracking tool, stmp aims to make time management as seamless as possible.

## Features

- **Work Hours Tracking**: Easily log your start and end times for each work day.
- **Break Duration**: Keep track of your break times to ensure you're taking adequate rest.
- **Notes**: Add notes to each work day for better context and recall.
- **Checks**: Check if your daily records are complete.
- **Data Dump**: Export your data to stdout or a file for further analysis or backup.

### Automatic Work Hours Tracking

Configure your machine in such a way, that start and end time are automatically tracked with your powering on and off of your machine and set your default break duration. The automatic tracking should always use the `--overwrite False` Flag.
